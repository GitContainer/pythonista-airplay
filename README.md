#### Demonstration of using two screens via airplay in pythonista
Thanks to [Zrzka](https://github.com/zrzka) for the initial code posted to Pythonista forums showing an HDMI example.
I've added two simple buttons that increment a label on the second screen.

#### To Test
Simply mirror your phone or tablet to an AppleTV connected display and then run `main.py`.
